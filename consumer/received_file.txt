Hello, this is a test file for NDN transmission!
This file contains multiple lines of text to test the segmentation functionality.
Line 3: Testing data transmission over NDN.
Line 4: This should be split into multiple segments if large enough.
Line 5: Each segment will be transmitted separately.
Line 6: The consumer should be able to retrieve all segments.
Line 7: And reassemble them into the original file.
Line 8: This completes our test data.
